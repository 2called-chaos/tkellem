# tkellem

tkellem is an IRC bouncer, a proxy that keeps you permanently logged on to an
IRC server and stores all messages so that when your client next connects, you
can see the backlog of what happened while you were gone.

tkellem supports multiple device-independent backlogs, and connecting to
multiple IRC servers all from the same process.

## IMPORTANT

This is a very, very early version. Only the basic functionality is implemented.
You probably don't want this yet.

## Usage
