    Manage networks. --add will add a new network, or a new connection host to an existing network. Public networks can only be created by admins, and can be joined by anybody.

    To connect to a network, change the server username in your irc client to reflect what network you want to connect to, in the form of username@network. For instance, to connect to a network called "freenode" as the user "joe", you would set your username to joe@freenode

    Examples:
        NETWORK --add --public freenode irc://irc.freenode.org:6667
        NETWORK --add freenode ircs://irc.freenode.org:7000
