user_registration:
  help: |+
    Allow new users to register themselves with this instance of tkellem, rather than having to create all users through the tkellem console. Set to 'open' to allow self-registration, 'verified' to allow self-registration but require admin approval before activation, any other value means closed registration.

    New users will register themselves by connecting to tkellem with a username but no password and no network specified. The tkellem bot will walk them through the process.

allow_user_networks:
  help: |+
    If 'true', allow users to create their own networks with the `/tkellem network` command. Otherwise, users can only join admin-created public networks.
